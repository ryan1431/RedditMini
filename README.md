# "Redditable" - A Productivity-Focused Reddit Client

## About the Project
Redditable is a modified Reddit client which provides users with content aimed towards productivity, learning & self-improvement. This is optimal for people who prefer to use Reddit for learning, and want to keep distractions to a minimum. Popular entertainment subreddits such as r/memes, r/funny, etc. therefore are not available in search results or categories. Furthermore, a timer is shown counting upwards at the top navigation which provides the user's total view-time in a given day & week.

### Scope & Limitations

- This client currently does not support user login, therefore any user interactions (upvote, downvote, comment, etc) are not available. 
- This project uses predefined search queries to provide subreddits, therefore there is a limited amount of subreddits available
- While there is a search function, the search queries only available subreddits from the sidebar categories
   - This is to prevent entertainment subreddits from accidentally showing up in a search query
- News subreddits have been intentionally omitted
